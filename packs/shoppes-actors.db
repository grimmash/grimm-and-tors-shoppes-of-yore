You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":4600000,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"d9a2b1b41b7c6f03e9278baa960a4ccdd43aa95a"}}},{"_id":"PlsSQ9o2GGycrVvk","name":"Stick of Incense","type":"loot","img":"icons/commodities/wood/bamboo-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When blocks of incense cannot be used or a cheaper alternative is required, people often use these to perfume the air, whether for pleasurable or religious purposes.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 151","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0.2,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"common","identified":true,"damage":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":4300000,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"80c550843af5876709ae1c6c16e1b2cd33d3ab27"}}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"0a50cf5c28c1eb03eb4304802336fc375c51d620","sourceId":"Actor.2dehMjK0b5adC6At"},"core":{"sheetClass":"core.MerchantSheet","sourceId":"Actor.2dehMjK0b5adC6At"},"merchantsheetnpc":{"priceModifier":1,"buyModifier":0.5,"stackModifier":20}}}

The being must be known to you: a god, a Primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).</p><p>When the creature appears, it is under no Compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its Services.</p><p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or Magic Items to an allied Temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of Treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p><p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon Duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p><p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of Experience Points awarded.</p><hr /><h3>Scroll Details</h3><hr />\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 16 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p><hr /><h3>Earthquake (Level 8)</h3><hr /><p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the Duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p><p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s Concentration is broken.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional Effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.</p><p><strong>Fissures</strong>. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.</p><p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures</strong>. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the Nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</p><hr /><h3>Scroll Details</h3><hr />\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 18 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</li>\n<li><strong>Discord.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw.

While Frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</li>\n<li><strong>Hopelessness.</strong> Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful Abilities, Spells, or other magical Effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Insanity.</strong> Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take Actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its Movement, which is erratic.</li>\n<li><strong>Pain.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes Incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep.</strong> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls Unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save.

When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{Suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"random-properties\"><strong>Random Properties</strong>. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties (see DMG pg. 219-21): </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties </li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spells\"><strong>Spells</strong>. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} (5th-level version, 3 charges)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight} (1 charge)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{Death Ward} (2 charges)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{Scrying} (3 charges).</li>\n<li>You can also use an action to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Call Dragons</strong>. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will.

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.</p><p><strong>Antipathy.</strong> The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.</p><p><strong>Sympathy.</strong> The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.</p><p>If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</p><p><strong>Ending the Effect.</strong> If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p><hr /><h3>Scroll Details</h3><hr />\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 18 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional Effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.</p><p><strong>Fissures</strong>. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.</p><p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures</strong>. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the Nature of the rubble.

The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p><p><strong>Hedged Prison</strong>. The spell transports the target into a tiny Demiplane that is warded against teleportation and Planar Travel. The Demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p><p><strong>Minimus Containment</strong>. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or Planar Travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p><p><strong>Slumber</strong>. The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p><p><strong>Ending the Spell</strong>. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The Conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable Actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or Hit Points.</p><p>A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p><p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following Effects of your choice for the Duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asleep</strong>. The target falls Unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.</li>\n<li><strong>Panicked</strong>. The target is Frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.</li>\n<li><strong>Sickened</strong>. The target has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends</li>\n</ul><hr /><h3>Scroll Details</h3><hr />\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 16 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>\n<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Save DC</strong>: 17<br /><strong>Attack Bonus</strong>: +9.</p>\n<p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 238","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":1280,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"veryRare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":1,"max":1,"per":"charges","autoDestroy":true,"autoUse":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":9,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":0,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"scroll","attributes":{"spelldc":10},"level":6},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"60a2ceb35c27e29728617b162eb562b8248a717c"}}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"f2a6093b400d85de221be2d7f25f7f94d7ce642b","sourceId":"Actor.pjtaMYIaXGKp7oi1"},"core":{"sheetClass":"core.MerchantSheet"},"merchantsheetnpc":{"priceModifier":1,"buyModifier":0.5,"stackModifier":20}}}
