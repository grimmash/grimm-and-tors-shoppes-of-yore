If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p>\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 10 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>\n<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Save DC</strong>: 13<br /><strong>Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DMG pg. 200","quantity":2,"weight":0,"price":10,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"common","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":"Spell must be on the caster's spell list."},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":1,"max":1,"per":"charges","autoDestroy":true,"autoUse":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"msak","attackBonus":5,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"consumableType":"scroll","attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vNe7knl6ISEUx3ET":3,"dA8jduoC7taw4eEN":2},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.MerchantSheet","sourceId":"Actor.WlNcyHxXlF1AQLQh"},"merchantsheetnpc":{"priceModifier":1,"buyModifier":0.5,"stackModifier":20,"disableSell":true,"limitedCurrency":true,"keepDepleted":true,"service":false,"hideBuyStack":false,"maxBuyPercentage":""}},"_id":"TwVZJLUpUu7wrv0U"}
