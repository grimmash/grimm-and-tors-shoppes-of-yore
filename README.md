[Merchant NPC Sheet](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/merchantsheetnpc)

This module was built using the `Merchant NPC Sheet` mod, and the pre-generated actors are all using that sheet setting.  However, you could try using any other loot or merchant mod that uses `RollTables` to populate.

# Installation
- Install from Foundry or manually via the manifest.
- Import the compendia starting with 'Shoppes'.  You may want to set up folders for this or sort them, as there are quite a few.
- The actors are set up as "shelves" with titles indicating what they have pre-stocked.
- Adjust permissions on the actors so you players can interact with them.
- Review the items, re-stock or manually add items to taste, and check on prices.  Sometimes the prices require you to close and reopen the NPC sheet to take effect.  All prices are from the SRD compendium.

# Basic Design
This module has sorted all of the items in the 5e SRD into various `RollTable` entities, drawing directly from the `Items (SRD)` and `Trade Goods (SRD)` compendia.  The exception is spells scrolls, which were created as items and then placed in item compendia by spell level.  From those, roll tables for spell scrolls were also built.  Those `RollTables` are then used either on their own, or in some cases combined into weighted tables that draw from other tables.  In the end all merchant NPCs can be relatively easily populated via the various `RollTables` in the module compendia!
